A digital garden is a place for the seeds of ideas to be planted, to be fertilized and watered with attention and love, so that over time they may sprout into amazing, complex, inspiring things. I am the gardener, growing my thoughts and knowledge into something I can share with others by writing.

A digital garden is a place of incompleteness. Nothing within is ever finished. There is no definition of done. It's a constant work in progress. The seeds of your my are forever growing.

A digital garden is a place of freedom. I am free from the barriers that for years stood in my way of writing: perfectionism, the need to perfect every last word and phrase, and the fear of saying something stupid in public.

In this garden, none of the old ways of thinking matter. Spread your ideas as you please. Write as much or as little as you like. As long as you're writing, it doesn't much matter what it is you're writing about or how complete it is.

Writing challenges your mind. Writing connects ideas, uncovers mistakes, and considers new paths. Writing makes you [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/), which is the fastest way to learn after all.

Stop worrying and start planting! Write, dammit!
