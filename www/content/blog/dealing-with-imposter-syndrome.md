The problem with being human is that you have a mind. And many minds love
nothing more than to beat themselves up.

We call this "imposter syndrome" when it comes to the career-related things, but
I think it's just a general symptom of existance as a human.

My friend Kait texted me today to ask me for some advice.

> How do you deal with imposter syndrome? Logically I know I must know what I'm

> know what I'm talking about

To help Kait, myself, and others deal with this issue, I made this post to serve
as a collection of my best advice.

# Follow other developers on Twitter

Every once in awhile, the imposter syndrome topic flares up on Twitter and lots
of people share their experiences with it.

What I've learned from reading their tweets is this: no matter how successful
you become, you'll sometimes feel like maybe you're not as great as you think
you are.

Especially when you hit roadblocks or deal with failures.

Following other devs on Twitter is helpful because it reminds you that even the
best, most respected developers struggle with the same issue.

And this also hits on the other point about feeling like an idiot when talking
to someone higher up than you: they may be more senior, but they also sometimes
feel like they're not good at what they do. You're intimidated by this person's
seniority, but they may be secretly questioning their own skills at the same
time.

We're all in the same boat here.

# Keep a list of the things you're proud of

When you feel like an imposter, it's helpful to have something you can reference
to pull you back to reality.

This might be a physical list you keep in Google Docs or Notion, or maybe it's
just a list you keep in your head.

Either way, being able to easily remind yourself that you've kicked some serious
ass in your career and the types of asses that you've kicked helps keep your
lying mind in check.

# Get involved in open source

The most consistently rewarding experiences I have as a developer come from
being involved in open source projects. There's no better feeling to me than to
drop in on a project to contribute your skills and knowledge just because you
can.

Not only do you get that warm feeling from contribution, but it also gives you
things to add to your list of things you're proud of!

# Tell your friends or co-workers that you're struggling

If there's one thing most people love to do, it's helping others that are
struggling. Friends and co-workers are a source of strength and encouragement,
and will gladly give you the boost you need to remember that you're better than
your mind is letting you think you are.

But they can't help if they don't know you're dealing with it!
